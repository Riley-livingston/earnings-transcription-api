[1726842970.01] Speaker: good day and welcome to the light power Technologies physical fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call all participants will be in lesson only mode shouldn't need assistance with signal or conference specialist by president of Turkey followed by zero after today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions to ask a question you may press certain one on your telephone keypad
[1726842979.24] Speaker: to ask a question you may press certain one on your telephone keypad to which are your questions please press start and choose please note this event is being recorded I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Miranda Chief Financial Officer please go ahead thank you good afternoon everyone before we get started like to remind you that during the course of this conference call the company will be making a number forward
[1726842994.50] Speaker: remind you that during the course of this conference call the company will be making a number forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations involve various risks and uncertainties and discussed in his periodic SEC filings although the company believes that the assumptions underlying these statements are reasonable any of them can be proven to be inaccurate and it could be no assurances that the projected results would be realized in Edition references made by
[1726843005.65] Speaker: reference is made by maybe made to certain Financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or Gap we refer to these as nongap Financial measures please refer to our SCC reports in a certain of our press releases which include Financial measures and Associated disclaimers Sam will begin today's call with an overview of the business and recent developments for the
[1726843017.54] Speaker: Sam will begin today's call with an overview of the business and recent developments for the company I will then review Financial results for the quarter and the full year following are prepared remarks there will be a formal question and answer session I would now like to turn the conference over to Sam Ruben light paths president and chief executive officer thank you all good afternoon to everyone and welcome to light up
[1726843030.84] Speaker: spell Technologies physical fourth quarter and full year 2024 Financial results conference call as always I will Financial results was issued after the market closed today and posted it to our corporate website physical 2024 was an important year in our transformation from Pure component supplier to a system provider delivering during the year and you products new contracts and starting to see growth driven by the new product line
[1726843041.08] Speaker: can you contract and starting to see growth driven by these new product lines just over three years ago we sat on a new course with a new strategic Direction taking us from being a pure component supplier to a systems or Solutions provider for those not familiar with this I will provide a brief overview prior to this shift has been for the greater part of 30 years and Optical component provider what many years ago
[1726843050.40] Speaker: about 30 years and Optical component provider what many years ago was a unique technology molded updates had become over the over the years a crowded Marketplace going through the classic transformation and commoditization decreasing and with them margins and profits in 2021 we set a course on a new strategic Direction
[1726843060.86] Speaker: in 2021 we set a course on a new strategic Direction one that leverages some of our key Technologies to deliver subsystems and system level Solutions instead of just components aiding in this have been too important shifts happening in our industry first Optics or photonics more generally as a whole is being used
[1726843075.49] Speaker: starting to use a technology Seeker partner that will provide a complete Optical solution rather than components they would need to build in themselves so essentially the structure of the supply chain of our industry is changing creating an opening or opportunity for a company like light off to become a Solutions provider this transformation has been
[1726843087.67] Speaker: Solutions provider distance transformation has been very successful and in this fiscal year we reported that 20% of our Revenue came for those activities this type of Revenue hardly existed before we began going down this path the second change happening that enabled us has been around infrared imaging technology which have been evolving at the fast rate finding their way into a growing number of uses and therefore
[1726843100.78] Speaker: finding their way into a growing number of uses and therefore expanding the temp to totally adjustable Market I would call Technologies both that we owned already and developed internally through licensing and for Acquisitions of all centers around infrared Imaging Technologies allowing us to create significant differentiators in this fast growing Market space the outcome of that has been growing our infrared components
[1726843117.06] Speaker: the outcome of that has been growth in our infrared components business to be Now 44 percent of our overall Revenue in the last fiscal year overthinking the Legacy business of pmo Precision Optics both of those areas more than offset the DraStic decline in that Legacy Precision business that we've seen today the conclusion of our fiscal 2024 year
[1726843129.55] Speaker: today is the conclusion of our physical 2024 year we can see the positive outcomes of this shift and more importantly is exponential growth we are seeing coming as a result of that we're seeing coming down the road as a result of that who are investment in differentiating Technologies we have positioned ourselves as a leader in the field of internal with an exclusive license from the government to commercialize the new materials
[1726843141.01] Speaker: play an exclusive license from the government to commercialize the new materials developed at NRL as well as our partnership with Department of Defense defense Logistics agency around replacing Germania in DOD applications we not only are they go to partner for everyone looking to phase out germanium but have also earned ourselves a seat at the table and some of the most important discussions and projects in the defense world and by the way that I would
[1726843154.45] Speaker: directions and projects in the defense world and by the way is that our defense sales at the all-time high right now for example in April we announced a first design win of our new one of our new glass materials from Annabelle in this program of record we are the sole source for a key part of a new inferred Imaging system which we expect could bring Revenue in tens of millions of dollars a year in production
[1726843164.47] Speaker: Revenue in tens of millions of dollars a year in production 4 years ago we could only dream of being in such a position of not only being part of a key program but also being the sole source for it this program by the way is program of record which means it is a line item in Congressional budget and funded for several years into the future and this is just one of multiple programs we have now exclusive
[1726843175.43] Speaker: this is just one of multiple programs we have now exclusive materials or winning us those programs in all of which with sole source due to their specificity and naturally since those are all defense programs were a bit Limited in what we can share but try to share as much as we can in addition to our investment in materials is differentiating Technologies we also invested in development of our camera Technologies as well as
[1726843190.38] Speaker: we also invested in development of our camera Technologies as well as the important acquisition of visiting Technologies a year ago which fed into this without any new technologies and further leveraging our unique materials and other differentiators we have built over the last couple of years a portfolio of unique thermal cameras that have created a strong entry point for us into a system level product
[1726843204.51] Speaker: strong entry point for us into a system level product and enable us to now curve out a market share in a market estimated to be 9 billion of 10 and growing rapidly our efforts in the camera business started with introducing mantis and Innovative Broadband or multi-spectral inferred camera that is a first of its kind and enabled purely by our
[1726843218.95] Speaker: unique materials from Annabelle mantis served as a perfect Innovative product to draw draw attention to us as a new camera manufacturer positioning us as an Innovative entrant and open the door to important conversations with customers as a result of that we not only became a camera supplier but started working with customers on
[1726843233.50] Speaker: started working with customers on their uniquely needs leading to more products that are driven by the customer requests and needed in the market this includes thermal cameras for Harsh environments High sensitivity cameras for Unique applications such as gas detection and most recently sorry canvas system for inspecting and optimizing performance of furniture
[1726843243.73] Speaker: camera system for inspecting and optimizing performance of furnaces in power plants steel mills paper mills and more with specially proud of this new product because of its price tag of 30,000 per unit representing better than which represents better than anything else the transformation the company has gone through from selling lenses with asbs of dollars of dollars
[1726843254.28] Speaker: play lenses with aspects of dollars of dollars at best 50 Nails in thousands of tens of thousands of dollars this is significant of course for future growth of the company as selling 100 cameras at 30,000 each has a completely different math there were top-line growth and selling just lenses that go into those cameras what used to be our tire business model similar to the material
[1726843269.84] Speaker: Alafaya business model similar to the materials technology is differentiator has landed us the Lockheed Martin missile program under this program light bulbs subsidiary with Technologies which we acquired last year is developing for Lockheed Martin in a new camera system that would be part of a missile system due to pressing needs from the customer
[1726843281.11] Speaker: US Army the program is now on a very accelerated timeline so it started only a year ago we have already achieved a worthy qualification of our subsystem and can begin and can begin shipping units for flight tests which we're going to do over the next few months the program is potentially transformative for like path
[1726843292.10] Speaker: the program is potentially transformative for Life Path not only is it exactly the type of business we were targeting in our new strategy but the size of the opportunity can completely transform us blocked Martin wins against Raytheon which they are competing against we expect to be seeing revenues between 50 million to 100 million a year once in full production though we are still in development
[1726843302.02] Speaker: once in full production though we are still in development the progress of this project is so fast that Lockheed and the customer already looking to start setting up for elephant low rate initial production next year which is the last step before full production for a company our size 35 million dollars or so in Revenue a contract like this it could be 50 to 100 million dollars can
[1726843314.59] Speaker: 100 million can completely transform us and although there is a possibility that Lockheed will not win this against rape you know that this technology we developed is so transformative and important that the same customer is already integrating it into a into at least two additional programs this technology by the way was developed by visited
[1726843327.91] Speaker: list technology by the way was developed by visited acquisition and moves from R&D into program of record shortly after we acquired resume for about 3 million dollars last summer and other exciting development on the camera camera technology AI technology is making an impact in many areas and many customers and users are looking for ways to leverage some of those advanced
[1726843341.22] Speaker: and many customers and users are looking for ways to leverage some of those advancements in the technology for their own use case or application one important area AI technology has evolved is Invasion where your networks can be trained to do many of the tasks that until now required a human operator for example inspecting items on a production line identifying an object or someone
[1726843353.10] Speaker: inspecting items on a production line identifying an object of someone entering into a space such as an intruder or a drone and so on in fact so much work has been done on applications for use of AI and vision that ideas and trained modules are abundant and growing rapidly in conversations with customers we learned that the challenge is not so much what to do with an AI
[1726843363.76] Speaker: not too much what to do with an AI model but rather have to do it currently anyone wanting to implement an AI module in real life has one of the two options using a virtual service such as AWS and other data GPS centers or installing an Nvidia or equivalent GPS system the first one using AWS or other online services
[1726843376.34] Speaker: play AWS or other online services requires streaming which clubs the bandwidth and in many times facilities do not allow that due to cybersecurity constraint not to mention big delays and latency of the images the second option using an Nvidia GPU or so requires use of a device such as a GPS that has a very high power consumption and very high upfront costs limiting its usefulness
[1726843385.90] Speaker: assumption and very high upfront costs limiting its usefulness in most field applications to overcome that and to not only make it possible to implement AI in the camera but also affordable in cost and power total cost of ownership we have integrated a powerful AI accelerator chip made by Israeli Halo into the camera can accept neural network
[1726843396.46] Speaker: listen to the camera this AI chip can accept neural networks in standard formats such as onnx or tensorflow or others and one of those AI modules in the cameras video pipeline it's a very low power consumption and almost no latency with high computational power of 26 Topps 1268
[1726843407.76] Speaker: this offering of a so-called AI ready camera if you want has generated significant talk and interest in the industry and we are now working with some very interesting projects and customers that have already advanced AI Solutions and need a friendly Hardware to implement it all taking this approach of focusing only on the hardware and not developing an AI neural networks so is driven by
[1726843417.92] Speaker: and not developing an AI neural network of service is driven by two of our core values focus and in this case focusing on what we are good and letting our customers focus on what they look at and value Creation in this case the value Creations making AI implementation easier for our customers okay after talking about those two pillars of growth of
[1726843431.73] Speaker: turn off the talking about those two pillars of growth out of our own three pillars of growth will give a quick update and overview about the third one automotive and those that follow us know lights off has been working with several Tier 1 and tier 2 in the other world to develop and qualify thermal imaging solutions for using Adidas though we all ready we were already on track to start delivering units to an oem for a new mandate by
[1726843446.18] Speaker: units to an oem for a new car modules a new mandate set by national highway traffic safety administration has impacted that implementation negatively in the short term but created a much bigger long-term opportunity according to the new rule by 2029 all new cars should be should include an emergency braking system that can identify pedestrians in pitch dark conditions from
[1726843454.99] Speaker: that can identify pedestrians in pitch dark conditions from a certain distance to achieve that it looks like thermal imaging is going to be adopted into all of those systems which means a much much larger addressable Market than estimated first even though further out than we hope that first from our conversations in the industry we believe the Auto industry is going to use this time to
[1726843464.97] Speaker: we believe the Auto industry is going to use this time to develop a solution that will allow thermal cameras to be installed behind the windshield of the car this in turn will significantly simplify some of the challenges faced today in terms of environment and location of the company in of the camera in the car light bar has solutions for both scenarios camera setting inside the car or behind the outside of behind the windshield and we will
[1726843476.93] Speaker: inside the car or behind the outside or behind the windshield and we will continue to work on those with our customers Automotive opportunity is still very significant for us there was a timeline is shifted further prior to the highest an hour according to what we currently see we will continue to ship lower volumes of years and see
[1726843487.94] Speaker: play ship lower volume of in the incoming a couple of years and see volume shipments begin to ramp up in our fiscal 2027 okay I will now turn this call to see if I can talk about the numbers of the information
[1726843500.86] Speaker: press release issued earlier today and will be included in the 10K for the period I encourage you to visit our website to access these documents I will discuss some of the primary financial performance metrics and provide additional color on them to better assist investors and analyzing the company on a Consolidated basis revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter or 8. 6 6
[1726843509.16] Speaker: play 6 million compared to 9.797% for 3 million or 35% of the company Consolidated revenue revenue from visible components was 32 million or 37% of Consolidated revenue revenue from assembly and modules or 1.4 million or 16% revenue from Engineering Services was 1 million or 12% infrared component
[1726843519.61] Speaker: Hearing Services was 1 million or 12:00 infrared component sales decreased approximately 1.7 million or 36% primarily due to decrease in sales against the large annual contract for germanium based products which was not renewed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 as we decided to reduce the amount of Optics we produce both
[1726843527.38] Speaker: we produce from germanium both to reduce our risk of supply chain disruption and more importantly to work with customers to convert their systems to use Optics made of our Black Diamond materials visible component sales were approximately 3.2 million or flat in comparison to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year by industry there was a decrease in sales to defense customers due to timing of orders and
[1726843538.87] Speaker: there was a decrease in sales to defense customers due to the timing of orders and an increase in sales for us catalog and distribution channels assemblies modules Revenue decreased approximately 0.2 million or 14% primarily due to sales of a custom visible lens assembly to a medical customer for which we have an end-of-life going into fiscal 2025 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year
[1726843549.84] Speaker: going into fiscal 2025 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 this customer requested a greater number of units shipped whereas in fiscal year 2024 this this this this this decrease was partially offset by the addition of Disneyland Revenue Engineering Services increased approximately 0.9 million or 698%
[1726843563.43] Speaker: Chris is increased approximately 9 million or 698% primarily driven by Billy meds contract with Lockheed Martin where revenue is generally recognized based on the achievement of Milestones gross margin of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately 2.5 million a decrease of 0.6 million or 18% as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year total cost of sales is approximately
[1726843572.16] Speaker: is the same quarter of the prior fiscal year total cost of sales is approximately 6.1 million for the 4th quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to approximately 6.6 million for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year gross margin is a percentage of Revenue is 29% for the 4th quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 32% the same quarter of the prior fiscal year the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of Revenue
[1726843581.25] Speaker: why are fiscal year the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of Revenue is primarily due to the overall decrease in Revenue resulting in lower contribution to our fixed manufacturing cost sequentially gross margin improved from 21 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as we move past the inventory revaluation administrative costs
[1726843594.07] Speaker: selling General administrative costs for approximately 3.6 million for the 4th quarter of fiscal 2024 and increase of approximately 6 million or 20% as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year the increase in sgna for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 is primarily due to an increase in wages including non-recurring executive
[1726843605.41] Speaker: including non-recurring executive Severance cost and an increase in legal Consulting fees related to certain Business Development initiatives we also encourage additional Legal Professional fees associated with the previously disclosed Delaware Chancery Court proceedings that was for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately 2.4 million or 6 cents basic and diluted to 0.8 million or two cents
[1726843616.78] Speaker: compared to 0.8 million or 2 cents basic and diluted loss per share for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year the increase in net loss of approximately 1.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross margin coupled with increased operating expenses including amortization of intangibles
[1726843626.20] Speaker: including amortization of intangibles even though for the quarter ended June 30th 2024 was a loss of approximately 1.3 million compared to income of 0.1 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year the decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was primarily attributable to decrease in revenue and gross margin coupled with increases in a and other
[1726843640.66] Speaker: primarily related to non-recurring items to results for the year ended June 30th 2024 revenue for fiscal 2024 was 31.7 million a decrease from 32.9 million in the prior fiscal year sales of infrared components were 14.1 million or 44% of the company's Consolidated Revenue in the year ended
[1726843649.56] Speaker: 1 million * 444 percent of the company's Consolidated Revenue in the year ended June 30th revenue from visible components was 11.2 million or 35% of the Consolidated revenue revenue from assemblies and solutions for 4.5 million or 14% of total company revenue revenue from Engineering Services
[1726843661.74] Speaker: in fiscal 2024 infrared sales decreased 0.3 million or 2.2 decreased in revenue is related to the previously mentioned germanium based annual contract that was not renewed during the fiscal year this decrease was mostly offset by an increase
[1726843674.02] Speaker: during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for higher dollar value than the previous contract visible component Revenue decreased approximately 2.2 million or 16% decrease in revenue is primarily due to a decrease in sales to customers in the defense industry as well as a decrease in sales for catalog and distribution channels in the US and Europe
[1726843689.38] Speaker: what channel is in the US and Europe sales to customers and Telecommunications industry in China also decreased assembly Solutions Revenue decreased approximately 0.2 million or 5% primarily due to a decrease in shipments against the multi-year contract with a defense customer due to timing as well as decreases in cells of infrared assemblies to Industrial customers have been decreasing
[1726843698.60] Speaker: covid-19 these decreases were partially offset by the addition of busy Med revenue from sales of infrared camera course Engineering Services increased approximately 1.5 million or 363
[1726843710.90] Speaker: 12.3 million for the fiscal 2024 and increase of approximately 0.9 million or 8% as compared to the prior fiscal year for fiscal 2024
[1726843722.48] Speaker: Business Development initiatives these increases are partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation we also encourage additional legal and professional fees and fiscal 2024 associated with our reschedule annual stockholders
[1726843733.31] Speaker: cost to remain elevated for the next few quarters as we continue with certain Business Development initiatives net loss for fiscal 2024 was approximately 8 million or 21 cents basic and diluted loss per share compared to approximately 4 million or 13 cents basically the increase in net loss for fiscal 2024 is compared to
[1726843745.29] Speaker: increase in net loss for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 is attributed to approximately 4.3 million increase in operating loss resulting from low Revenue gross margin and an increased operating expenses operating expenses increases included the non-recurring items previously mentioned as well as increased new product development costs and 0.5 million increase in the amortization of intangibles
[1726843755.60] Speaker: pause and 0.5 million increase in the amortization of intangibles resulting from the visit acquisition this operating loss increase was partially offset by a decrease in other expense approximately 0.1 million primarily due to the decrease in interest expense and Edition there was a favorable difference of approximately 0.2 million in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2024
[1726843768.86] Speaker: 3.7 million compared to 0.4 million for the fiscal 2023 the decrease in fiscal 2024 is primarily attributable to lower Revenue increased operating expenses
[1726843779.54] Speaker: Business Development initiatives as of June 30th 2024 we had working capital approximately 7.5 million in total cash and cash equivalents of approximately 3.5 million less than 50% of our cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operations
[1726843790.62] Speaker: cash provided by operations was approximately 5 million for fiscal 2024 compared to cash used and operations of approximately 2.8 million for the prior fiscal year the increase in cash flow from operations during fiscal year 2024 is primarily due to decrease as an accounting 2024
[1726843804.79] Speaker: Capital expenditures are approximately 2.2 million for fiscal 2024 compared to approximately 3.1 million in the prior fiscal year the company also expanded approximately 0.9 million to acquire Vizio Med during fiscal 2024 years 2024 and 2023 in August 2023
[1726843815.54] Speaker: in August 2023 we completed the construction of certain tenant improvements subject to our continuing lease for Orlando facility of which the landlord provided 2.5 million and 10 in Improvement allowances we founded the balance of the tenant Improvement cost of approximately 3.7 million or fiscal year is 23 and 24 August the company
[1726843825.72] Speaker: the purpose of the note is for business development initiatives and capex in excess of plan should we need it I'll add more content on capex and cash and fiscal year 2025 in a minute and 30th 2024 was approximately 19.3 million a decrease of 11% as compared to 2 1. 7 7
[1726843831.54] Speaker: decrease of 11% as compared to 2 1. 7 9 5
[1726843843.59] Speaker: significant contract renewal from our largest customer for infrared products made of germanium during the second fiscal quarter however as previously disclosed we decided to reduce the amount of Optics we produce from germanium and more importantly to work with the customer convert their systems to use Optics we continue to work with this customer service
[1726843850.97] Speaker: partially offset by a significant contract renewal for advanced optics for a critical International military program
[1726843857.53] Speaker: in fiscal 2024 and we finally completed the alignment of the production facilities around the world in China
[1726843865.21] Speaker: authorized work for NATO and the EU authorized Defense work us was far more ambitious than scale over the last 15 months we consolidate the operations increase
[1726843874.73] Speaker: increase the clean room by a factor of 2 and also modernized it prepping it for significant growth with minimum future Investments required in addition we restructure the organization to remove layers remove complexity and Reporting structures and redeployed employees towards our growth areas three structuring of light path globally is
[1726843884.77] Speaker: is a good accomplishment by itself in 2024 we also acquired visit integrated it and were awarded the Lockheed Martin contract and have already reached flight Milestone a significant event now and for the future all these activities were executed very well
[1726843899.41] Speaker: you come with a cost and you can see that in the net income and cash flow they do come with a benefit our estimates are that we've removed roughly 1.2 million in structural cost that will be permanent going forward I'm not pointing out all of this to go to some unrecognized credit for work but rather explains of the past
[1726843913.51] Speaker: play fiscal year 2025 the effort to fix problems of the past build a world-class organization are largely done going forward we will not invest in capex anywhere near the levels of the past 2 years now our efforts will turn to growth Sam mention all the potential opportunities in front of us to capitalize on these opportunities
[1726843923.83] Speaker: all the resources of the company people and cash will be geared towards Business Development initiatives which includes sales marketing product development and high-tech IRS assemblies amongst other things the stage has been set in 2025 we have the potential and we have the ability to execute it should be a very exciting year
[1726843935.45] Speaker: the ability to execute it should be a very exciting year I sincerely thank all of you for the support with this review of our financial highlights recent developments and my editorial comments thank you Google
[1726843947.03] Speaker: Google Now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press start in one on your telephone keypad and if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your hands up before pressing the keys if at any time your question has been addressed and you'd like to withdraw your questions please press start then choose the first question comes from Brian Kaner with Alliance Global Partners please go ahead
[1726843956.06] Speaker: liquor with Alliance Global Partners please go ahead thanks so much and your pipeline and a lot of things you've discussed how should we think about 2000 fiscal 2025 in terms of Revenue just from a high level do you expect a year of double-digit growth given this year was for this past year
[1726843965.15] Speaker: a year of double-digit growth given this year was for this past year was depressed how do you think about seasonality and as your largest customer I was unclear have they begun to order black diamond Optics hey Brian the first the first answer is that if you would take the low end of double-digit growth is our expectation for growth for the next fiscal year
